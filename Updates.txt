Current planned updates

1. headless gen: add optional file input to command line (after headless has been rebuilt calling the new algorithms)

2. math review:
    a. decouple math page: allow n/a, and read if available: 
        i. math page sheet name, then
        ii.  volatility index, rtp 
    b. Mean and volatility may not be right, with the larger # tables? 
          . weighted mean calculation: https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/weighted-mean/
          . noting to follow Scott's formula: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sumproduct-function-16753e75-9f68-4874-94ac-4d2145a2fd2e
          . sum of squares https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sum-of-squares.asp
    c. double check betting/credits/wallet

    Followup on 2: worked through the 'math' with the team, it is correct for what we're doing with it now
        Updates needed: 1. to decouple the passing of variables between the tkGui, Simulator, and Math/Excellerator
                        2. also, how the 'Math' sheet is found/used, and setting detaults if not so that we avoid that error

3. slowdown issue: 
    a. the larger the tables, the more quickly it drags. 
    b. better sort or iterative ways to do it?    <---- this was the issue
    c. is the code tight? does it break after finding the right values?
    d. is one of the functions slowing it down? 
    
    3.1: the *problem* is iterrows() .. which is apparently very, very slow.

        3.1.a. This should use itertuples() instead. 

4. done - plotting and gui elements 
    a. done - solved the maximum credits plotting issue, retaining the max between spins, by implementing globals
